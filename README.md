## HISTORY OF HERKLE HUB FOR SPELLING BEE
Herkle Hub was the very first Spelling Bee script. It started out rough, with only a label that showed you the current word, a copy word button and an auto type. Upon the realization that other scripts were in development, I decided to rewrite it. The first rewrite ended with Herkle Hub being barely the best Spelling Bee script, with a few holes here and there. Only one other script had ever topped Herkle Hub, and that was when I stopped updating the script. After a few months of not updating Herkle Hub and scripts like Preppy Hub maintaining updates, I decided to do a full rewrite of Herkle Hub for Spelling Bee, which is the current version below. At the time of writing this, Herkle Hub has ZERO competition and is undeniably the BEST Spelling Bee script.
