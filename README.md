the BEST script for Spelling Bee, by Beans Can. the script has 50+ features, like Auto Type with tons of customization, Auto Typo, Free Emotes (unreleased emotes too), and everything in between. (including a remastered version of the first version of this script, so you can JUST see the word and how to spell it, without having the entire script open)
below are some screenshots of every feature
